//! USE-flag evaluation vocabulary, shared from `portage-solver`.
//!
//! `UseConfig`/`UseFlagState`/`UseOverride` and the caller-side `apply_package_use`
//! helper are the single source of truth in [`portage_solver`]; this module just
//! re-exports them so existing `portage_atom_pubgrub::` import paths keep working.
//! `portage_solver::UseConfig` already implements `portage_atom::UseFlagLookup`,
//! so the solver's dependency conversion sees flag state through the same trait.
