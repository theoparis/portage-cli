//! Bridge between [portage-atom](https://crates.io/crates/portage-atom) and the
//! [PubGrub](https://crates.io/crates/pubgrub) dependency solver.
//!
//! Maps PMS package atoms to PubGrub's `Package`, `Version`, and `VersionSet`
//! traits, and provides a `DependencyProvider` implementation backed by a
//! package repository.
//!
//! # USE Flag Handling
//!
//! The caller resolves the **desired** USE state per package version (profile,
//! `make.conf`, `package.use`, and IUSE defaults are *its* concern) and hands it
//! in; the solver never resolves policy itself. See
//! `docs/use-and-solver-boundary.md` for the current/desired/needed model.
//!
//! USE conditionals in dependency strings are then handled via a hybrid strategy:
//!
//! - **User-decided** flags (`enabled` / `disabled`) are eagerly evaluated at
//!   registration time — the solver never sees those branches.
//! - **Solver-decided** flags are encoded as virtual packages with two versions
//!   (0 = OFF, 1 = ON). PubGrub's one-version-per-package constraint provides
//!   mutual exclusion for free.
//!
//! ## `SolverDecided` drives Level-C `REQUIRED_USE` auto-satisfaction
//!
//! The solver-decided path lets PubGrub *choose* a flag's value to satisfy
//! constraints — strictly more powerful than portage, which freezes USE before
//! resolving. A flag the caller marks [`UseFlagState::SolverDecided`] (with a
//! `prefer` value — the greedy keep-configured bias `choose_version` applies)
//! becomes a two-version `UseDecision` node; the package's `REQUIRED_USE` is
//! encoded over those nodes at ingestion (`convert::encode_required_use`),
//! so the emitted plan satisfies it by construction.
//!
//! By default nothing is ceded: the cli hands the solver a fully fixed USE
//! set, `REQUIRED_USE` violations stay post-solve advisories ("Level A"), and
//! the plan matches portage's. The reference consumer cedes flags only under
//! its opt-in `--autosolve-use`, and only for packages whose `REQUIRED_USE`
//! the fixed config actually violates ("Level C"). The concern split (caller
//! decides *which* flags are free and the preference; the crate decides
//! *values*), encoding, and phasing live in `docs/required-use-level-c.md`
//! and `docs/use-and-solver-boundary.md`. Global minimal-flip optimisation is
//! out of scope — the preference is greedy, per flag.
