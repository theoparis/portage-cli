# Project Conventions

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo test                        # Run all tests (unit + doc)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings       # Lint — must be warning-free
cargo fmt --check                 # Format check — must pass
cargo doc --no-deps               # Build docs — must have no warnings
```

## Architecture

- One primary type per module (`package.rs` -> `PortagePackage`, `version_set.rs` -> `PortageVersionSet`, etc.)
- Modules are private (`mod`, not `pub mod`); public API is flat re-exports in `lib.rs`
- Bridges portage-atom types to pubgrub traits (Package, VersionSet, DependencyProvider)

## Dependencies

- `portage-atom` — PMS atom parsing and types
- `pubgrub` — PubGrub version solving algorithm
- `version-ranges` — Interval set type used by pubgrub
- `thiserror` — Error types

Any new dependency must be justified.

## PMS Compliance

This library implements the [Package Manager Specification (PMS)](https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/9/pms.html).
All public types must reference the relevant PMS section in their doc comments.

## Coding Style

- `rustfmt` — all code must be formatted
- No dead code, no unused dependencies
- Doc comments on all public types, fields, and enum variants
- Tests live in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block at the bottom of each module

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` — new functionality
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behaviour change
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `ci:` — CI/CD changes
- `chore:` — maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

## MSRV

Minimum Supported Rust Version is **1.92** (dictated by pubgrub).
CI tests against both stable and MSRV.

## Slop Warning

This codebase was largely AI-generated. Be skeptical of existing code — it may
contain bugs, incomplete PMS coverage, or surprising edge-case behaviour.
Do not assume existing patterns are correct; verify against the PMS.
