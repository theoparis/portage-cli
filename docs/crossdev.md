# `em crossdev` — cross-compilation targets

`em crossdev` is `em`'s built-in workalike for Gentoo's `crossdev` tool: it
sets up a cross-compilation target (a `CTARGET` tuple like
`riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`) so you can build a cross-toolchain and then
cross-build ordinary packages against it, all through `em` itself — no
separate `crossdev` binary, no on-disk symlink overlay.

This is the user-facing how-to. For the design rationale (why the category
is derived on the fly, how root/config resolution works across `--target`/
`--prefix`/`--local`, the `PackageArch` host/target split) see
[`root-topology.md`](./root-topology.md) and
`../todo/root-topology-refactor.md`/`../todo/crossdev-target.md`.

## The model, briefly

- **`--target <tuple>` is one flag, two roles.** `em --target T crossdev
  --init-target` *sets up* tuple `T`; `em --target T stages --stage1` (or
  any plain atom build) *uses* the already-set-up `T`, resolving/installing
  into the target sysroot. There's no separate `-t` for crossdev — `--target`
  is global.
- **`cross-<tuple>/<pkg>` packages are derived on the fly**, not symlinked on
  disk. `--init-target` writes a `Location::Alias` `repos.conf` entry that
  maps the `cross-<tuple>` category onto the real `::gentoo` ebuilds
  (`sys-devel/binutils`, `sys-devel/gcc`, …). The eclasses (`toolchain.eclass`
  etc.) do the actual cross-compilation magic, triggered by the category name
  — `em` doesn't reimplement cross-compilation, it just builds the aliased
  ebuild phases with the right env.
- **Two package classes live in the same category.** `binutils`/`gcc`/
  `clang-crossdev-wrappers` (and any `--ex-pkg` extra) are **host-arch**
  tools: they run on the build machine and produce code for the target, so
  they install onto the host/prefix, not the sysroot, and get unconditional
  keyword acceptance (`**`) since no arch check makes sense for them.
  `linux-headers`/the libc/the LLVM runtimes are **target-arch**: they
  install into the sysroot and get target-ABI env.
- **The sysroot** is `<EROOT>/usr/<tuple>` — `/usr/<tuple>` for a bare/
  privileged setup, `<prefix>/usr/<tuple>` under `--prefix`/`--local`/
  `--root <dir>`.

## Flags

```
em crossdev [OPTIONS]
```

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--target T` / `-T T` (global) | the tuple to set up or use, e.g. `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| `--show-target-cfg` | print the derived config (category, sysroot, package set) and exit — no writes |
| `--init-target` | lay down the overlay alias + sysroot `make.conf`/`make.profile`, no building |
| `--setup` | bootstrap the full cross toolchain (binutils → headers → gcc-stage1 → libc → gcc-stage2) into the sysroot; implies `--init-target` |
| `-L` / `--llvm` | use the LLVM/Clang model (`cross_llvm-<tuple>`: host clang cross-targets directly, no per-target compiler build) instead of GCC |
| `--ex-pkg CATEGORY/PN` | build an extra package onto the target (repeatable); see [Extra packages](#extra-packages-ex-pkg---ex-gdb) below |
| `--ex-gdb` | shorthand for `--ex-pkg dev-debug/gdb` |

Plus the usual global flags: `-p`/`--pretend` (preview, write nothing),
`-a`/`--ask` (preview and confirm before writing), `--prefix DIR`/`--local`/
`--root DIR` (where the target lands — see `root-topology.md` for the full
matrix).

### Supported tuples

The tuple's suffix picks the libc/OS model (crossdev's own `parse_target`):

| suffix | libc | kernel headers | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `...gnu`, `...gnueabi`, `...gnueabihf` | glibc | yes | `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| `...musl` | musl | yes | `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| `...elf`, `...eabi`, `...newlib` | newlib (bare metal) | no | `riscv64-unknown-elf` |

`-L`/`--llvm` rejects glibc targets outright (matching real crossdev — LLVM
can't currently build glibc); use a musl or bare-metal tuple with `-L`.

## Examples

### Preview a target before touching anything

```
$ em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --show-target-cfg
  Target    riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
  Model     GCC
  Category  cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
  ARCH      riscv
  Profile   default/linux/riscv/23.0/rv64/lp64d
  Sysroot   /usr/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
  CFLAGS    -O3 -march=rv64gc -pipe
  Packages
    cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/binutils → sys-devel/binutils
    cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/linux-headers → sys-kernel/linux-headers
    cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc → sys-devel/gcc
    cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/glibc → sys-libs/glibc
```

No writes happen — this is purely informational, and works before
`--init-target` has ever been run.

### Set up a target (privileged, classic crossdev layout)

```
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target
```

Writes the alias `repos.conf` entry and the sysroot's own
`etc/portage/{make.conf,make.profile}` under `/usr/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
Nothing is built yet.

### Bootstrap the full cross-toolchain

```
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --setup
```

Implies `--init-target`, then runs the staged bootstrap (binutils → headers
→ gcc-stage1 → libc → gcc-stage2) through the normal merge path. Preview
first with `-p`:

```
em -p --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --setup
```

### Unprivileged, under `--prefix`

Everything above works identically under `--prefix`/`--local`/`--root DIR` —
the sysroot and config just move under the prefix instead of the real host
`/`:

```
em --prefix /opt/xp --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target
em --prefix /opt/xp --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --setup
```

Sysroot lands at `/opt/xp/usr/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`; the alias/env
config lands in `/opt/xp/etc/portage`.

### Preview and confirm config changes

`--init-target` (and `--setup`'s own config-laydown step) diffs what it's
about to write against what's already there, so it's safe to re-run and
plays along with `-p`/`-a`:

```
$ em -p --prefix /opt/xp --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target
>>> config changes:
  update /opt/xp/etc/portage/repos.conf/crossdev.conf

$ em -a --prefix /opt/xp --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target
>>> config changes:
  update /opt/xp/etc/portage/repos.conf/crossdev.conf

>>> Would you like to write these 1 config file(s)? [y/N] y
>>> cross target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu ready
    ...
```

A re-run with nothing to change prints no config-changes noise at all — just
the normal "ready" summary.

### Build the target's package set

Once the toolchain exists, use the same `--target` flag with the ordinary
`em` commands — no separate entry point:

```
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu stages --stage1     # packages.build bootstrap set
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu --emptytree @system # full target-native @system
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu sys-apps/coreutils  # one target package
```

These resolve and install into the target sysroot (`<EROOT>/usr/<tuple>`),
using the sysroot's own `make.conf` for `CHOST`/`CFLAGS`/keywords.

### Build one cross-category package directly (no `--target` needed)

A `cross-<tuple>/<pkg>` atom fully identifies its own target through its
category name, so you don't need `--target` at all to build one directly —
just name it like any other atom:

```
em --prefix /opt/xp -p cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc
```

Combining this with `--target` at the same time doesn't do what it looks
like it does: `--target` sets up a *separate* dual-root session for
resolving ordinary (non-cross-category) packages against the target sysroot
— a different concern from naming a cross-category atom directly. Don't mix
them for this use case.

### Extra packages (`--ex-pkg`, `--ex-gdb`)

The base toolchain set (binutils/headers/gcc/libc) is fixed, but you can add
more host-arch tools onto an established target — crossdev's own "Extra
Fun". These are **per-invocation**, not persisted: a later `--init-target`
that omits the flag drops the extra again, exactly like real crossdev.

```
# Build a cross-gdb (dev-debug/gdb) alongside the toolchain:
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target --ex-gdb

# The Rust standard library for this target (sys-devel/rust-std — its own
# ::gentoo DESCRIPTION literally says "standalone (for crossdev)"), needed
# to cross-compile Rust code targeting the tuple:
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target --ex-pkg sys-devel/rust-std

# Multiple extras, repeatable:
em --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target --ex-gdb --ex-pkg sys-devel/rust-std
```

Pick a genuine standalone host-arch tool for `--ex-pkg` — something that
isn't already an ordinary transitive dependency of anything in the
toolchain's own build closure (`sys-devel/rust-std`, like `dev-debug/gdb`,
is built purpose-made for this — real crossdev's own `--ex-gdb` precedent).
A widely-depended-on package (e.g. `dev-vcs/git`) is a poor choice: it's
liable to already be pulled in transitively by something else in the
closure (e.g. a doc-build BDEPEND), which only creates confusion about what
`--ex-pkg` actually added.

After that, the extra resolves like any other cross-category package — no
`--target` needed:

```
em --prefix /opt/xp -p cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/gdb
```

`--ex-pkg` atoms must be `CATEGORY/PN` (validated as a real `Cpn`, and
checked to actually exist in `::gentoo` before the alias is written) — a
malformed or nonexistent atom is rejected up front with a clear error rather
than surfacing later as an opaque resolver failure.

### LLVM/Clang model

```
em --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl -L crossdev --show-target-cfg
em --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl -L crossdev --setup
```

No per-target compiler build — clang already cross-targets. The category is
`cross_llvm-<tuple>` instead of `cross-<tuple>`, and the package set is the
clang wrapper + LLVM runtimes (`compiler-rt`/`libunwind`/`libcxxabi`/
`libcxx`) instead of the GCC toolchain stages.

## Gotchas

- **`--target` alone doesn't imply a config has been set up.** Run
  `--init-target` (or `--setup`, which implies it) at least once before
  using `--target T` for ordinary builds — otherwise the sysroot has no
  `make.conf`/`repos.conf` and nothing resolves.
- **Extras aren't sticky.** If you want `dev-debug/gdb` to keep resolving,
  pass `--ex-gdb` every time you re-run `--init-target`/`--setup` — it's not
  remembered from a previous run, on purpose (matches real crossdev).
- **`cross-<CTARGET>/gcc` and `sys-devel/gcc` are different packages that can
  drift.** The former is the host-side cross-compiler built once by
  `--setup`; the latter is whatever ordinary compiler version
  `stages --stage1`/plain merges install *into* the target sysroot. Upgrading
  one doesn't upgrade the other.
- **Don't hand-edit the generated config.** The sysroot `make.conf`, the
  per-package `env/<category>/<pkg>.conf` files, `package.env`, and
  `package.accept_keywords` are entirely `em`-owned and unconditionally
  regenerated on every `--init-target`/`--setup` re-run — any hand edit is
  silently discarded (this matches real crossdev, which does the same for
  its equivalent files). The `[crossdev]` alias `repos.conf` entry behaves
  the same way once it's recognisable as `em`'s own. The one thing that *is*
  left alone is a **foreign** `[crossdev]` entry — one with no
  `alias-target =` key, e.g. a real crossdev/eselect-managed physical
  overlay — `em` never touches that.
