//! The solver abstraction both bridges implement.
//!
//! [`Solver`] covers the post-construction surface a consumer needs: feed in
//! installed packages and knobs, then run [`Solver::resolve_targets`], which
//! returns the owned [`Plan`] (selected packages, labelled graph, install order)
//! together with the solver's advisory output (dropped deps, ceded USE
//! decisions, violations).
//!
//! Construction is intentionally **not** part of the trait: each bridge takes
//! its own `PackageRepository` adapter and options via a concrete `new`, so the
//! consumer picks the bridge at the call site (e.g. `em --solver=resolvo`) and
//! then talks to it through `Box<dyn Solver>` (or the concrete type). Knobs
//! that only some bridges support (cross-compilation host/sysroot sets) stay
//! bridge-specific extension methods on the concrete type; the trait models the
//! common native path that both bridges implement.

///    [`crate::PackageRepository`] adapter and any bridge-specific options.
/// 2. Register installed packages via [`Solver::add_installed`] and set knobs.
/// 3. Call [`Solver::resolve_targets`] with the resolve targets — a single
///    joint solve over a synthetic root — and read the returned [`Plan`].
