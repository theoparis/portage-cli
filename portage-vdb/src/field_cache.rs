//! Process-wide memoization for VDB flat-file reads, keyed by absolute path.
//!
//! This module knows nothing about `std::fs` or any other I/O backend —
//! [`get_or_fetch`] takes a closure that performs the actual uncached read,
//! so the cache stays correct regardless of how (or from where) a field is
//! ultimately fetched. [`package`](crate::package) is the only current
//! caller, and is the one that knows it's reading real files.
//!
//! A VDB entry is immutable once written except through [`crate::Vdb::register`]
//! (overwrite in place, e.g. a same-version USE-flag rebuild) or
//! [`crate::Vdb::unregister`] (removal) — both call [`invalidate_entry`] for
//! exactly that entry, so the cache reflects "as of the last write this
//! process made" rather than a point-in-time snapshot that could go stale
//! across a real merge run. That's what makes a process-wide cache safe
//! rather than just fast: independent VDB scans of the same root (measured:
//! `em -p`'s depgraph build reads the host VDB's USE/IUSE 3-4 separate times
//! across `Avail::initial_bdepend`/`initial_depend` and
//! `load_target_installed`/`load_host_installed`) share one read instead of
//! each re-reading the same file from disk.
