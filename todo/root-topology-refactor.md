# Root topology refactor — tracked tasks

Design doc: [`docs/root-topology.md`](../docs/root-topology.md). This file
tracks the implementation work it implies. Status: 🔴 not started · 🟡 partial · ✅ done.

## Why

The cross/stage session exposed structural debt: `Roots` is a flat bag of five
`Option<PathBuf>` fields, and `host_roots`/`base_roots()` is threaded
positionally across 9 files. Three "wrong root at one site" bugs (`c421c95`,
`732aefe`, `0e9b3e0`) and the `host_aliases` invariant violation (`208c818`)
all stem from no type telling callers which root answers which role. The
refactor replaces the bag with a `RootTopology` enum whose variant answers
`satisfaction_root(dep_class)` as a pure function.

## Behaviour changes (correctness, not just types)

These are the divergences between current code and the target model in
`docs/root-topology.md` § "Override semantics". Each is a real behaviour change
to land as part of (or before) the refactor.

- ✅ **`--root` config resolution — resolved 2026-07-09, not the way originally
  proposed.** Original framing: "`--root` no longer moves config" (portage
  `ROOT=` parity, `config: config_root.or(root)` → `config: config_root`).
  Attempted, reverted, and replaced with a narrower, correct fix after two
  rounds of live findings:
  - **First attempt**: make `config()` default to host, falling back to the
    offset only when `<offset>/etc/portage/make.profile` already exists
    (real ROOT= parity as the common case, self-contained roots still "just
    work" once bootstrapped). **Broke `em select`'s toolchain-slot lookup**:
    a live test (`current_slot_reads_the_active_gcc_config_profile`) caught
    `select/mod.rs`'s `config_portage_dir_for` — a *second*, independent
    consumer of `roots.config()` beyond `crossdev`'s bootstrap — silently
    falling through to the **real host's** `/etc/env.d/gcc` for a
    freshly-created, not-yet-bootstrapped self-contained root (proven with
    real host state: this dev machine's own `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`
    gcc-config slot 16 leaked into a supposedly-isolated tempdir test).
  - **Checked real `eselect` for precedent** (at the user's suggestion):
    `/usr/share/eselect/modules/profile.eselect`'s `get_symlink_location`
    does `local root=${PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT-${EROOT}}` — it only ever honours
    an *explicit* `PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT` (or `EROOT`, which a standalone
    invocation never has set); it never cleverly derives a config root from
    `ROOT` alone. `select/mod.rs`'s own doc comment already said as much
    ("`--config-root`... else `--prefix`/`--local` overlay, else `/`" — no
    mention of `--root`) — the actual code just didn't match its own
    documented intent, a pre-existing bug the first attempt's revert
    happened to expose, not something the first attempt caused.
  - **Landed fix**: `Roots::config()` (the merged, build-facing value used by
    `profile_stack`/`expand_sets`/`repos_conf`/crossdev's own bootstrap) is
    reverted to its original, unconditional `config_root.or(root)` — this is
    `em`'s own deliberate self-contained-bootstrap default (own config, own
    everything), not a portage `ROOT=` gap, and touching it broke more than
    it fixed. New, separate `Roots::config_root_explicit()` — *only*
    `--config-root`, never derived from `--root` — is what `select/mod.rs`'s
    `config_portage_dir_for`/`is_prefix_context_for` now use instead of
    `config()`, matching real eselect: `em --root R select ...` reads the
    **host's** config unless `--config-root R` is also given. New
    `Roots::is_self_contained_root()` (topology-only: no EPREFIX, base ==
    target, not bare host) replaces the old `config().is_some()` proxy in
    `crossdev/mod.rs`'s `ensure_self_contained_prefix`/`ensure_prefix_profile`
    — behaviourally identical to before, just no longer coupled to
    `config()`'s exact definition. New
    `Roots::with_own_config_root_if_self_contained()` covers the *internal*
    orchestration case (`crossdev::activate_toolchain`'s own
    gcc-config/binutils-config slot activation for a root it just
    bootstrapped itself) — it forces its own config root without requiring
    the user to also type `--config-root` on every crossdev invocation,
    exactly mirroring how portage's own `{target}-emerge`/build tooling
    exports `PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT` internally rather than expecting the user to.
  - **`--config-root /` already gives literal portage `ROOT=` parity** for
    anyone who wants config to stay at the host for a plain `--root` build
    (e.g. sharing config with an already-installed host system) — no new
    code needed for that direction, it was already the existing escape hatch.
  - Regression tests: `cli.rs` unaffected (no `config()` behaviour change);
    `select/compiler.rs`'s existing
    `current_slot_reads_the_active_gcc_config_profile` updated to pass
    `--config-root` explicitly (the new correct way to test this), plus a
    new `current_slot_ignores_bare_root_without_explicit_config_root`
    asserting the reverse — bare `--root` must *not* pick up the offset's
    env.d, and the internal `with_own_config_root_if_self_contained()` path
    does. Live-verified end-to-end: `em --root R setup` +
    `em --root R --target T crossdev --init-target` still bootstraps
    `R/etc/portage/{make.conf,make.profile,repos.conf}` correctly
    (unaffected); `em --root R --config-root R select compiler show -t T`
    reads a slot written into `R/etc/env.d/gcc` while `em --root R select
    compiler show -t T` (no `--config-root`) reads the real host's instead.
- ✅ **`--local` becomes standalone, not overlay.** Landed in `b3f20c1`.
  `base` goes from None (host) to Some(prefix), so base == target ==
  ~/.gentoo — full closure, self-contained VDB. Live-verified in
  crossdev-stages: `em --local -p bzip2` shows `[N] bzip2` +
  `[N] app-alternatives/bzip2` (full closure; reads the empty prefix VDB,
  not the host's). Previously base=`/` would have hidden both.
- ✅ **Host-python/host-tool symlinks moved from `--local` to `--prefix`.**
  Landed in `b3f20c1`. setup.rs's three-mode split (self-contained /
  standalone / overlay) gates `link_host_pythons`/`link_host_base_tools` on
  `is_overlay` (--prefix), not `is_local`. Live-verified:
  `--local`'s `usr/bin/` is empty; `--prefix`'s has python3.13/3.14/find/xargs
  symlinked to /usr/bin.
- ✅ **`--prefix` sets EPREFIX=P.** Landed in `b3f20c1`. Live-verified:
  `em --prefix /opt/test-prefix dev-python/jinja2` builds and merges clean —
  host python3.14/gpep517/flit-core drive the build (BROOT=host), result lands
  in the prefix VDB (counter=1), host VDB untouched (jinja2 counter stays
  395).
  scripts shebang to `${EPREFIX}/usr/bin/...`, so EPREFIX=P is required for
  the host-python symlinks (above) to actually fire.
- ✅ **Split BROOT from install target under `--prefix`.** Landed in
  `21638aa`. `base_roots()` now returns a BROOT view (merge_root=`/` under
  --prefix), and `roots()` reconstructs the prefix-target view on top. Without
  this, `preflight::check` read BDEPEND from the *prefix's* empty VDB instead
  of the host's, failing the jinja2 build with "not satisfied" even though the
  host had all of gpep517/flit-core/python:3.14. Regression test:
  `prefix_overlay_broot_is_host_not_prefix`.
- ✅ **`--root`'s BROOT is the host, not the offset (portage `ROOT=`
  parity).** The fifth behaviour change, missing from this list until
  2026-07-09: `base_roots()` had `base: R, target: R` for plain `--root R`,
  so `merge_root()` (read as BROOT by `preflight`/`bdepend_avail`/
  `load_host_installed`) was the offset itself — BDEPEND satisfaction
  checked the (usually near-empty) offset VDB instead of the real host's.
  Found live: task #17's `--root .../cross-stage1-riscv64 --cross riscv64...
  systemd-utils` kept failing on `jinja2 found: NO` even though the real
  host already has jinja2 for its own python.
  - **The fix went through two passes.** First pass introduced a `RootSet`
    enum (`Single`/`Dual`/`Overlayed`, matching `docs/root-topology.md`'s
    proposed shape) and made `base_roots()` itself return the host for
    `--root`. That broke a *different* thing: `base_roots()` is also relied
    on as "the outer EROOT, `--cross`-substitution undone" by
    `crossdev/mod.rs`'s `bypass_cross_root` (where crossdev's own
    toolchain-bootstrap packages install) and by `write_cross_env`/
    `write_sysroot_config` (which write config those steps read back) — all
    of which correctly need the *offset* for `--root`, not the host. Caught
    it by re-testing `em --root R --cross T crossdev --init-target`, which
    started hitting a real, *new* permission error (`write_cross_env` trying
    to write `/etc/portage/env/...` — the real host — instead of `R/etc/portage`).
  - **Second pass, landed:** reverted `base_roots()` to its original
    behaviour (still "the outer EROOT", unchanged for every flag) and added
    a new, dedicated `Cli::broot()` — the *only* thing that differs from
    `base_roots()`, and only for plain `--root` (BROOT = host `/` there;
    identical to `base_roots()` for `--prefix`/`--local`, where the two
    already agreed). Repointed the four call sites that actually mean BDEPEND
    satisfaction (`emerge.rs`, `dispatch.rs`'s `equery depgraph`,
    `crossdev::resolve_gcc_version`, `merge/mod.rs`'s `entry_roots` host
    routing) from `base_roots()` to `broot()`; left `bypass_cross_root`/
    `write_cross_env`/`write_sysroot_config`/`activate_toolchain` on
    `base_roots()`, untouched. Regression test: `root_broot_is_host_not_offset`
    (checks `broot()` **and** `base_roots()` diverge correctly for `--root`).
  - **Re-verified end-to-end after the second pass**: `em --root R --cross
    riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev -t riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
    --init-target` now completes cleanly, unprivileged, with no `/etc/portage`
    write at all — `write_cross_env` correctly lands in `R/etc/portage`. The
    permission wall was **our own bug** from the first pass, not an inherent
    `--root --cross` limitation — corrected the record here (an earlier
    version of this note wrongly called it expected/by-design).
  - The old self-contained-BROOT-in-an-offset workflow (build everything,
    including BDEPEND tools, into the offset itself — what
    `/var/tmp/cross-stage1-riscv64` was actually doing) still has a home:
    `--local`, parameterized to accept a path (`--local DIR`, was a bare
    bool hardcoded to `~/.gentoo`) instead of plain `--root`.
  - Also found while verifying: the solver's BDEPEND routing genuinely
    differs by scenario, and this is by design, not a bug — `broot_filtered`
    (same-arch native `--root`, no `--cross`) routes an unsatisfied BDEPEND
    to `MergeRoot::Target` (build it into the offset itself); only
    `cross_target_runtime_deps` (true cross-arch, `--cross` with
    `CHOST != CBUILD`) routes it to `MergeRoot::Host`, which is what
    `broot()` now correctly feeds. So this fix's effect is specific to cross
    builds — a same-arch `--root pkg` (no `--cross`) was never affected by
    the BROOT bug in the first place, since that path doesn't consult BROOT
    for BDEPEND routing at all.

- ✅ **`crossdev -t T` doubly-nested the sysroot when a global `--cross T`
  was also set, and `--cross`/`-t` were two separate flags for the same
  concept.** Found while reviewing this arc: `crossdev/mod.rs`'s own
  `sysroot()`/`setup_root()`/`main_repo()`/`ensure_self_contained_prefix()`/
  `ensure_prefix_profile()` (the setup-action helpers) used `globals.roots()`
  — which is *already* `--cross`-substituted to the sysroot when the global
  flag is set — so appending `usr/<tuple>` again doubly-nested it
  (`<EROOT>/usr/T/usr/T`). Reproduced live with matching tuples (not just
  mismatched ones). Fixed by adding `Cli::outer_roots()` (extracted from
  `roots()`'s own "no `--cross`" branch, deduplicating that logic) and
  repointing every setup-only helper to it instead of `roots()`;
  `stage1()`/`profile_stack()`/`resolve_gcc_version` correctly keep `roots()`
  (they genuinely want the sysroot substitution).
  - User pushed back on the follow-up fix (a "reject if `-t` and `--cross`
    disagree" guard): two flags for the same concept that need a mismatch
    check are the smell, not something to validate around. Resolved by
    **removing `crossdev`'s local `-t`/`--target` entirely** and renaming
    the global `--cross` to **`--target`/`-T`** (no clash — `t`/`T` were
    unused everywhere). One flag now serves both roles: `em --target T
    crossdev --init-target` sets T up; `em --target T stages --stage1` (or
    any plain atom build) uses it. `CrossdevArgs.target` is gone;
    `crossdev::run` reads `globals.target` directly. Verified live: `em
    --root R --target T crossdev --init-target` (no local `-t` at all) lays
    down the sysroot at `R/usr/T` correctly, and running with no `--target`
    at all gives a clear error instead of silently guessing.
  - This is a case of the same underlying issue as the enum-migration
    item below, one level up: not just "which of several `Roots`-returning
    methods do I call", but "which of several *flags* mean the same thing".
    Worth keeping in mind during the `RootTopology` migration — check for
    other near-duplicate flag pairs while touching this code, not just
    near-duplicate accessor methods.

- ✅ **`--prefix`'s unsatisfied BDEPEND now weaves host∪prefix VDB and merges
  into the prefix, never the real host.** Found 2026-07-09 by re-deriving
  the topology from scratch: user's stated model — "if you are in --prefix
  you are supposed to install on the prefix the bdepends, the host vdb is
  weaved in ... what is in the prefix drives, but anything that host
  satisfies is not merged again if not explicitly requested" — didn't match
  the code. `Cli::broot()` (the only caller: `merge/mod.rs`'s
  `entry_roots`, used to physically merge a `MergeRoot::Host`-stamped plan
  entry) returned `root_set().broot()` uniformly — host `/` for both
  `--root` (correct, privileged) and `--prefix` (wrong: an unprivileged
  overlay can't write the real host). Latent, not yet hit live: every
  existing `--prefix` test/run happened to have its BDEPEND already
  satisfied by the host (`"host python3.14/gpep517/flit-core drive the
  build"` in this same file's live-test log below — no rebuild ever fired),
  so the wrong-merge-destination path was never exercised.
  - Fix: `Cli::broot()` now returns `outer_roots()` (merge_root == prefix)
    when `base_roots().is_overlay()`, instead of a host-anchored `Roots`;
    unchanged for `--root`/`--local`/bare. `.broot` (the satisfaction root)
    still resolves to the host either way — only the merge destination
    differs.
  - `Avail::initial_bdepend` (`bdepend_avail.rs`) and `load_host_installed`
    (`query/depgraph/installed.rs`) now additionally read the prefix's own
    VDB under `--prefix` (`roots.is_overlay()`), so a BDEPEND already built
    into the prefix by a previous run counts as satisfied. `load_host_installed`
    reads host first, prefix second — `add_host_installed`'s plain
    `HashMap::insert` then makes the later (prefix) entry win for a package
    present in both, matching "what is in the prefix drives".
  - "Not merged again if not explicitly requested" needed no new code — the
    solver's existing `host_satisfied_on_broot`/`append_unsatisfied_broot`
    (`provider/solve.rs`) already drop a satisfied BDEPEND edge outright,
    and an atom named explicitly on the command line is a separate,
    already-existing root-target path unaffected by this.
  - New regression tests: `cli.rs`'s
    `prefix_overlay_broot_merges_into_prefix_not_host`,
    `bdepend_avail.rs`'s `initial_bdepend_weaves_in_the_prefix_vdb_under_overlay`
    / `initial_bdepend_still_finds_host_only_entry_under_overlay`,
    `installed.rs`'s `load_host_installed_weaves_prefix_over_host_under_overlay`
    / `load_host_installed_still_finds_host_only_entry_under_overlay`,
    `merge/mod.rs`'s `host_entry_installs_into_the_prefix_under_overlay_not_the_host`.
    Added `Roots::for_test_overlay(host, prefix)` (test-only constructor)
    since the existing `for_test` collapses base/target/broot to one path.
  - Live-verified: `em --prefix <dir> setup` then `em --prefix <dir> -p
    dev-python/pip` (a real package with genuine `MergeRoot::Host`-routed
    build-time deps, not just the historically-tested host-already-satisfied
    jinja2 case) shows every single line — Host- and Target-routed alike —
    landing `to <prefix>/`, none on the real host. Confirms both the actual
    merge-destination fix and the sibling display fix below together.
  - **Found live, same pass: the `-p` display was a separate, stale code
    path.** `query/depgraph/root_aware.rs`'s `display_root` hardcoded
    `MergeRoot::Host => "/"` — correct before this fix (when `Cli::broot()`
    always *was* host), now stale: the pretend-mode merge list kept showing
    Host-routed entries as landing on `/` even though the real merge
    (`entry_roots`) now correctly sends them to the prefix. Fixed by adding
    `CrossContext.host_target` (computed once in `root_aware::detect`,
    mirroring `Cli::broot()`'s own `is_overlay()` check) and having
    `display_root` read it instead of a hardcoded path. Caught by actually
    reading live `-p` output line-by-line rather than trusting unit tests
    alone — the unit tests cover `Cli::broot()`/the weave correctly, but
    display formatting is a third, independent piece of code that was never
    exercised by them.
  - **Residual gap closed same day, on request ("low hanging fruit").** The
    combined `em --prefix P --target T` case still showed a `MergeRoot::Host`
    entry landing on `/` in `-p` output, because `CrossContext.host_target`
    was derived from `depgraph()`'s `roots` parameter (`cli.roots()`), whose
    `--target`-active branch always clears `eprefix`/`is_overlay()` — losing
    the very signal `host_target` needs. Fixed by threading the correct value
    in from outside instead of re-deriving it from the (possibly-substituted)
    `roots`: new `DepgraphOpts::host_merge_root: &'a Utf8Path` field, set by
    each of the 3 construction sites (`emerge.rs`, `dispatch.rs`,
    `crossdev::resolve_gcc_version`) from `cli.broot().merge_root()` — the
    same authority `merge/mod.rs`'s `entry_roots` already uses for the real
    merge, unaffected by `--target` substitution since it's derived from
    `base_roots()`. `root_aware::detect` now takes `host_merge_root` as a
    parameter instead of computing it from `roots.is_overlay()`.
    Regression test added (`root_aware.rs`'s
    `host_entry_displays_as_landing_in_the_prefix_even_when_roots_is_target_substituted`)
    using a `--target`-shaped `Roots` with a separately-passed prefix path,
    reproducing exactly the bug this closes. **Live-verified**: `em --prefix
    P --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --init-target` then `-p
    --with-bdeps sys-apps/systemd-utils` shows the Host-routed build chain
    (dev-lang/python + its own openssl/sqlite/glibc/timezone-data) landing
    `to P/`, while the Target-routed sysroot packages land `to
    P/usr/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/` — both correct, distinguishable in one
    `-p` run.

## The variant refactor (structural)

- ✅ **`Roots.satisfaction_root(DepClass)` — landed 2026-07-09.** Scoped down
  from the doc's original `RootTopology`/`RootSet`-as-storage proposal to a
  smaller, lower-churn fix with the same payoff: rather than replacing
  `Roots`'s flat-field shape with the enum (and renaming the type), added
  two fields — `broot: Option<Utf8PathBuf>` and `is_cross_arch: bool` — so
  **one** `Roots` value carries BROOT correctly even under an active
  `--target` sysroot substitution (previously `roots()`'s `--target`-active
  branch built a fresh `Roots` with `base = target = sysroot`, silently
  dropping BROOT — *that* was why a second `host_roots: &Roots` had to be
  threaded everywhere). `satisfaction_root(class)` is a small match using
  the table in `docs/root-topology.md` § "What `satisfaction_root` returns":
  `Bdepend` → `broot`; `Idepend` → `broot` if `is_cross_arch` else
  `merge_root()`; `Depend` → `base` when it genuinely differs from
  `merge_root()` (an overlay, e.g. `--prefix`) else `merge_root()`;
  `Rdepend`/`Pdepend` → `merge_root()`. Reused the **existing** canonical
  `portage_atom_pubgrub::DepClass` (`Bdepend`/`Idepend`/`Depend`/`Rdepend`/
  `Pdepend`, already shared by the solver's own dependency graph) instead of
  inventing a second, near-identical enum — caught this mid-implementation
  by the same "don't add something redundant" instinct this whole session
  has been about.
  - Migrated every call site that threaded a `roots`+`host_roots` pair
    purely to answer "where does BDEPEND resolve": `preflight::check` (now
    one `roots` param), `bdepend_avail::Avail::initial_bdepend`,
    `bdepend_trim::TrimCtx` (now one `roots` field), `query/depgraph/mod.rs`'s
    `DepgraphOpts` (dropped `host_roots`), `installed::load_host_installed`,
    `crossdev::resolve_gcc_version`, `dispatch.rs`'s `equery depgraph`,
    `emerge.rs`.
  - **`base_roots()`/`broot()` (the method) were *not* fully retired** —
    caught this correcting the plan mid-implementation: `merge/mod.rs`'s
    `entry_roots` needs a *full* `Roots` for a Host-routed entry (its own
    `config()`/`build_sysroot()`/`eprefix()`, to actually merge the package
    there), not just a satisfaction path — `satisfaction_root` can't replace
    that need, only the path-only call sites above. `broot()` stays, now
    documented as explicitly distinct from `satisfaction_root` (a full
    merge-destination `Roots` vs. a bare VDB-lookup path) rather than one of
    several same-shaped near-duplicates.
  - Regression tests updated to call `.satisfaction_root(DepClass::Bdepend)`
    instead of the old `.broot()`-as-a-path pattern; `Roots::for_test` now
    also sets `broot` so BDEPEND-satisfaction tests still see the same root
    without a separate `host_roots` value. Full workspace fmt/clippy/test
    clean; live-reverified `em --root R --target T crossdev --init-target`
    (single-nested sysroot, unprivileged) and a `--target`-active BDEPEND
    satisfaction path.
  - Did not pursue: the `CrossArch`-as-triples enum, or normalizing
    `Dual{broot,target}` with `broot == target` to `Single` — the `Roots`
    struct's own `is_cross_arch: bool` field covers the one thing the doc's
    `CrossArch` was needed for (the `IDEPEND` cell), and there was no
    `Single`/`Dual` variant distinction to normalize once the fix stayed
    field-based rather than enum-based.
- ✅ **Privatize `provider.packages` behind `package_data()` — landed
  2026-07-09.** `host_aliases` (`provider/mod.rs`) maps `Host`→`Target`
  identity, and every consumer must remember to call the alias-resolving
  `package_data()`. `dependency_graph` forgot once already (`208c818`);
  a full sweep found **12 more sites with the identical bug**, all reachable
  via `solution.iter()` (which legitimately yields `Host`-flavored entries
  under `--target`/`--prefix` builds) or public-API arguments:
  - `validate.rs`: `check_use_deps`, `check_repo_constraints`,
    `check_blockers`, `slot_operator_bindings` (6 call sites) — each silently
    skipped validation for a `Host`-routed package's USE-deps/repo-constraint/
    blocker/slot-binding.
  - `provider/post_solve.rs`: `compute_use_flag_requirements` (3 sites) and
    `effective_flag_new` — a `Host`-routed package's USE-flag-requirement
    cascade silently under-computed.
  - `provider/mod.rs`'s public `versions_for_pkg`/`deps_for` — currently
    unused by `portage-cli`, but broken for any future `Host`-flavored caller.
  - Also converted `branch_best_installed` (currently safe — its one caller
    always passes a virtual package — but converted anyway for
    defense-in-depth at zero cost) to the same accessor.
  - Confirmed safe, left untouched: `graph.rs`'s `self.packages.get(dp)` for a
    *virtual* `dp` (virtuals are never aliased — `ensure_host_instances`
    filters `!p.is_virtual()` before creating an alias) — converted to
    `package_data()` anyway purely because the field is now private and this
    site is in a different module; `provider/mod.rs`'s own internal uses
    (`add_installed`, the synthetic solver root insert/remove,
    `deps_reach_installed`'s virtual-guarded lookup) — genuinely not
    alias-sensitive, left as direct field access (same module as the
    declaration).
  - **Fix**: `packages` field changed from `pub(crate)` to fully private (no
    modifier) — a compile-time enforcement, not just convention: `graph.rs`/
    `validate.rs` are sibling modules of `provider`, not descendants, so a raw
    `.packages.get()` there is now a hard compile error, catching exactly the
    7 sites the privatization was meant to catch (confirmed by temporarily
    reverting the field to `pub(crate)` and one call site back to
    `.packages.get()` — it compiled again, proving the enforcement is real,
    not incidental). `post_solve.rs`/`solve.rs` are `provider`'s own
    submodules (private fields stay visible to descendants), so those needed
    manual conversion — not compiler-forced, but done for the same
    correctness reason.
  - New regression test: `validate.rs`'s
    `check_blockers_fires_from_a_host_routed_packages_own_blocker` — a
    `Host`-routed package (an unsatisfied BDEPEND, same `set_cross_active`/
    `set_with_bdeps` setup as `graph.rs`'s existing
    `host_package_bdepend_on_another_host_package_orders_correctly`) declares
    a blocker against a normal Target-side RDEPEND; verified this test
    actually fails without the fix (reverted the field + one call site
    temporarily, confirmed red, restored). Full workspace fmt/clippy/test
    clean (141 passing in `portage-atom-pubgrub`, was 140).
- 🟡 **Extract `dep_satisfaction_root(class, merge_root)` table** shared by
  the three solver functions (`cross_target_runtime_deps`/`host_native_deps`/
  `broot_filtered` in `solve.rs`) so they don't drift from `preflight`'s
  routing on the next IDEPEND shift.
  - **2026-07-09: re-checked, description still accurate** (confirmed via
    `git diff`/`git log` that `solve.rs` hasn't changed since the original
    read). The three functions differ along exactly two axes — which
    `MergeRoot` DEPEND/RDEPEND/PDEPEND get stamped with (`Target`/`Host`/
    unstamped) and which `MergeRoot` an *unsatisfied* BDEPEND/IDEPEND edge
    gets stamped with — so the extraction is a small `DepStampPolicy { runtime_stamp:
    Option<MergeRoot>, broot_unsatisfied: MergeRoot, include_depend: bool,
    include_bdepend: bool }` struct plus one shared body, not a literal
    per-`DepClass` table. Still valid, still low priority.

## Live test results (2026-07-05, crossdev-stages aarch64 sandbox)

Cluster A + the BROOT/target split were live-verified end-to-end in the
`crossdev-stages` aarch64-20260618T101350Z sandbox (full isolation, real
stage3, no host contamination):

- ✅ `em setup --local` — "standalone Gentoo-Prefix", empty `usr/bin/` (no
  host-python symlinks).
- ✅ `em setup --prefix /opt/test-prefix` — "ROOT-offset overlay",
  python3.13/3.14/find/xargs symlinked into `${EPREFIX}/usr/bin`.
- ✅ `em --local -p bzip2` → `[N] bzip2` + `[N] app-alternatives/bzip2`
  (standalone full closure; base reads the empty prefix).
- ✅ `em --prefix -p bzip2` → `[R] bzip2` only (overlay delta; base reads host).
- ✅ `em --prefix /opt/test-prefix dev-python/jinja2` — built + merged clean,
  host VDB untouched.
- ✅ `em --prefix /opt/xp crossdev -t riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu --init-target`
  — sysroot at `/opt/xp/usr/<tuple>`, overlay + make.conf routing correct
  (`PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR`=sysroot, `BUILD_PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`=host).
- ✅ `em --prefix /opt/xp cross-riscv64.../binutils` — built + merged
  (counter=1), cross wrapper layout correct, host VDB untouched.
- ✅ `em --prefix /opt/xp select binutils list/show/set` — fully prefix-aware:
  sees host (aarch64) + prefix (riscv64) profiles, distinguishes them, writes
  selection to prefix's env.d, installs the two-hop wrapper symlinks under the
  prefix. **No code changes needed** — `select/mod.rs:config_portage_dir_for`
  already honours `config_overlay`.

## Open follow-ups (found during live testing)

- ✅ **MAKEOPTS not parallelising gcc's build — re-verified 2026-07-09 via a
  real, complete gcc-stage1 + gcc-stage2 build.** Confirmed the sysroot's
  make.conf carries `MAKEOPTS="-j128"` (the earlier `crossdev-sysroot-
  makeopts` fix, still landed and test-guarded) and that `toolchain.eclass`'s
  `gcc_do_make` goes through `emake` (not bare `make`). The full cross
  toolchain bootstrap below (both gcc stages) completed in this session's
  timeframe rather than hanging at a serial compile, which is the real-world
  answer the original "load avg 1.15" observation needed. Not instrumented
  down to an exact parallelism measurement, but no longer an open question
  blocking anything — closing as resolved.
- **Top-level `em -j N` also setting MAKEOPTS — rejected 2026-07-09, not
  pursuing.** Decided against per-package/per-invocation MAKEOPTS
  auto-derivation from `--jobs`; `--jobs` stays scoped to parallel package
  merges only, MAKEOPTS stays purely a make.conf/env concern.
- ✅ **Full cross toolchain under `--prefix` — DONE, completed end-to-end
  2026-07-09**, resumed in a fresh `crossdev-stages` aarch64 sandbox (the old
  `/opt/xp` state from the previous session's host didn't exist on this
  machine). Found and fixed three real bugs and corrected one wrong fix along
  the way (full story below). Final live result: `em --prefix /opt/xp
  --target riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu crossdev --setup --jobs 4 --keep-going`
  completed all 6 steps clean —
  `binutils(1)→linux-headers(2)→glibc-headers(3)→gcc-stage1(4)→glibc(5)→
  gcc-stage2(6)`, ending `>>> cross toolchain riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu ready
  in /opt/xp/usr/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` with the compiler activated
  (`Switching cross-compiler to riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-15 ... [ ok ]`).
  Verified no host contamination: `/opt/xp/var/db/pkg/cross-riscv64-…/`
  correctly holds all 4 packages; the sandbox's real `/var/db/pkg` has zero
  `cross-*` entries. This is the first time this exact combination
  (unprivileged `--prefix` overlay + a genuine foreign-arch crossdev
  toolchain bootstrap) has completed successfully.
  - ✅ **Bug 1 — `bypass_cross_root` regression, the real root cause.**
    `em --prefix P --target T crossdev --setup` failed step 1 (binutils) with
    a 47-package DEPEND explosion tripping the os-headers preflight, then
    (once superficially "fixed") with `gcc: error: unknown value 'rv64gc' for
    '-march'`. Root cause: the `--cross`/`-t` -> `--target` unification
    earlier this same session (`bcde18a`) made `crossdev --setup` always run
    with the global `--target` flag active — but `crossdev::setup`'s own
    `run_staged` call still passed `bypass_cross_root: false` (harmless
    *before* the unification, since the tuple used to arrive via crossdev's
    own separate `-t` flag, which never touched `globals.target`). After the
    unification this silently made every toolchain-bootstrap step resolve
    against the *sysroot* (`cli.roots()`) instead of the outer EROOT
    (`cli.base_roots()`) — so `cross-<tuple>/binutils`, a host-arch tool,
    read the sysroot's target-arch make.conf (`CHOST=riscv64`,
    `CFLAGS=-march=rv64gc`) to compile itself, and its DEPEND closure
    (including `debuginfod`'s elfutils/curl/glibc chain) was checked against
    the empty sysroot instead of the host that actually satisfies it. Fixed:
    `crossdev::setup`'s `run_staged` call now passes `bypass_cross_root: true`.
    This is a **regression from earlier in this same session**, not a
    pre-existing bug — never caught because `--init-target` (the only
    crossdev operation live-tested right after the unification) doesn't reach
    `run_staged` at all.
  - ⚠️ **False fix, corrected on the user's pushback.** Before finding bug 1,
    the os-headers explosion looked like it needed `binutils`'s `debuginfod`
    USE flag force-dropped unconditionally (previously only dropped for
    `is_self_contained_bootstrap`). The user flagged this immediately
    ("smells a lot" / "you are tapering around") — rightly: once bug 1 was
    actually fixed, a live `-p` preview confirmed `debuginfod` can stay **on**
    (binutils shows `[ebuild R]` alone, no explosion) because `binutils`'s
    DEPEND now correctly routes to the host, which already satisfies the
    whole closure. Reverted the debuginfod change back to its original
    `is_self_contained_bootstrap`-gated form (and the two tests with it) —
    the real fix was `bypass_cross_root` alone. Lesson: a "fix" that makes a
    symptom go away isn't verified until you check whether a more targeted
    fix (the actual root cause) makes the workaround unnecessary.
  - ✅ **Bug 2 — found and fixed, the actual remaining blocker.** Step 3
    (`libc headers`) failed: `checking installed Linux kernel header
    files... missing or too old!` even though step 2 (`linux-headers`)
    reported a clean merge. Extensive live tracing (temporary `eprintln!`
    instrumentation in `ebuild.rs`, since reverted) confirmed `CTARGET`/
    `CHOST` were correctly different in the build shell, ruling out the
    package.env/CTARGET theory and a suspected `brush`-interpreter
    variable-scoping issue. **Independent review by a second model (Fable,
    at the user's request — "switch the investigation to fable and have a
    second look at the changes you made") found the real cause in ~25
    minutes by reading the VDB directly**: `bypass_cross_root: true` (bug 1's
    fix) routes through `cli.base_roots()`, but under `--prefix`,
    `base_roots()`'s `merge_root()` is deliberately the **BROOT** view (host
    `/`, `target: None` — see its own doc comment) — not the outer EROOT
    `bypass_cross_root` actually needs. Every toolchain step was merging onto
    the *sandbox's real host root* instead of `/opt/xp` — confirmed via the
    VDB (`cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/linux-headers` registered under the
    sandbox's real `/var/db/pkg`, not `/opt/xp/var/db/pkg`) and `walk_image`
    stripping the `P` subtree out of `${ED}` (since `eprefix=Some(P)` makes
    `ED = D + P`, so a merge rooted at `/` writes real files at `D/P/...`
    while `${ED}` search only ever looks under `D/`). Binutils "worked" only
    by accident (its real-arch binaries landing on the real `/usr/bin` is
    harmless to *notice*, unlike headers going missing from the sysroot).
    **Fixed**: every `bypass_cross_root`-adjacent call site changed from
    `base_roots()` to `outer_roots()` — `emerge.rs`'s own `roots` selection,
    plus `crossdev/mod.rs`'s `activate_toolchain`, `maybe_weave_in_gcc_update`,
    and `write_sysroot_config` (three more call sites with the identical bug,
    found by grepping for `base_roots()` after the first fix). `--root`
    (where `outer_roots() == base_roots()`, no `eprefix`) is a no-op change;
    `write_cross_env` already used `config_overlay()` rather than
    `merge_root()` and needed no change. Live-verified end-to-end (see the
    ✅ summary above) — this was the last blocker.
  - Sandbox: destroyed the ad-hoc `em-item6-9-test` sandbox (it had gotten
    contaminated by bug 2 merging onto its real root) and switched to the
    pre-existing `~/.cache/crossdev-stages/sandboxes/aarch64-20260618T101350Z`
    — already prepared from the 2026-07-05 session, so no re-sync needed;
    wiped its stale `/opt/xp` before retesting. `em` binary copied to
    `/opt/em/em` inside it, driven via `crossdev-stages sandbox run --name
    aarch64-20260618T101350Z "..."`.
- 🟡 **Full cross stage1 under `--prefix` — plan now computes, found and
  fixed a fourth real bug (host-arch cross-tool keyword acceptance), real
  build not yet run.** Attempting `em --prefix /opt/xp --target
  riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu stages --stage1` hit `maybe_weave_in_gcc_update`'s
  gcc-refresh sub-resolve failing outright: `resolution failed: __internal__/
  root 0 depends on cross-riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc 16.1.1_p20260613`.
  - **Root cause, precisely isolated**: `query/depgraph/mod.rs`'s
    `accept_arch = cross.target_arch().unwrap_or(arch)` is one blanket arch
    for the *entire* resolve. `cross-<tuple>/{binutils,gcc,
    clang-crossdev-wrappers}` are host-arch tools (they run *on* the build
    host; only their *output* targets the CTARGET), but get keyword-checked
    against whichever arch happens to be active for the invocation — the
    sysroot's target arch under `--target` (whose own generated make.conf
    happens to permissively accept `"{arch} ~{arch}"`, masking the problem),
    the bare host's real arch otherwise (typically stable-keywords-only, so
    a not-yet-stable gcc version is genuinely rejected there). Confirmed by
    isolating the exact repro: `em --prefix P -p '=cross-.../gcc-16.1.1...'`
    (no `--target`) failed the same way; the identical atom with `--target`
    also set succeeded — same package, same version, different result,
    purely from which arch axis was active.
  - Initially misdiagnosed as a generic "autounmask doesn't cover a masked
    *top-level/pinned* target atom" gap (traced `find_autounmask_candidates`,
    `query/depgraph/repo.rs:1037`, to confirm it only computes suggestions
    from `dropped_deps` — droppable dependency *edges* with an alternative,
    not a hard top-level atom pin with none) — real gap, but not what this
    needed; corrected after re-reading `accept_arch`'s own construction.
  - **Fix, much smaller than either of the above**: real portage's `**`
    keyword token ("accept regardless of keywords") already exists in `em`
    (`AcceptToken::Any`/`ArchAccept.any`, `query/depgraph/repo.rs:48,95-99`)
    and is arch-agnostic by construction. `write_cross_env`
    (`crossdev/mod.rs`) now also writes a `package.accept_keywords` entry
    (`{category}/{pkg} **`) for the host-arch tools (`!is_target_package`),
    reusing the exact same directory-of-files convention already used for
    `package.env` there. No solver/AcceptKeywords changes needed at all —
    this was the user's own suggested direction ("use the autounmask
    machinery we have... crossdev hacks in sad ways the right masks in a
    very ad hoc way") once the real per-package mechanism was found instead
    of a per-resolve dual-config-read.
  - Live-verified: after re-running `crossdev --init-target` (regenerates
    the config), `em --prefix P -p '=cross-.../gcc-16.1.1_p20260613'` (no
    `--target`) now resolves; `em --prefix P --target T stages --stage1 -p`
    now computes a full, real stage1 plan (hundreds of packages) instead of
    hard-failing. Remaining output at that point is a normal `-p` REQUIRED_USE
    advisory (`sys-apps/util-linux`'s `su? ( pam )`, `net-misc/curl`'s `quic?
    (...)`) — expected `-p` behaviour (matches emerge's own "changes are
    necessary" preview semantics), not a bug.
  - Not yet attempted: the actual (non-`-p`) stage1 build — a long,
    real compile, natural next step but its own separate pass.

## Verification (outstanding)

- 🔴 **Re-derive "stage1 complete" — accepted 2026-07-09, next up.** From a
  clean `--jobs 1` run of the 4 stragglers (bzip2, xz-utils, gettext×2), not
  the VDB spot check (`session-status-2026-07-05-needs-review.md`).
- 🔴 **Re-merge `app-alternatives/gpg-1-r3` — accepted 2026-07-09, next up.**
  With current `em`, expect `IUSE=nls ssl +reference freepg sequoia` in the
  VDB. If so, close #36 as "already fixed; stale entry" — verified via
  `regen_only` that current code produces correct IUSE
  (`iuse-vdb-already-fixed.md`).

## Out of scope (deferred)

- Tier 3 mutable-BROOT bootstrap on a foreign host (`build-environment.md`).
- Zero-config merged sysroot via `fuse-overlayfs`/`overlayfs` (M3).
- `binrepos.conf`, signing/verify, `em maint binpkg` tooling — see `PENDING.md`.
