//! Core Gentoo types and utilities
//!
//! This crate provides efficient types for working with Gentoo architecture
//! keywords and release media variants. It is designed for use in tools that
//! process large numbers of ebuilds or repository metadata, where string
//! deduplication provides measurable memory savings.
//!
//! # Architecture Handling
//!
//! [`Arch`] represents a CPU architecture, mapping to the corresponding Gentoo
//! keyword when the architecture is known (e.g., `"amd64"`, `"arm64"`). Unknown
//! or overlay-specific architectures are stored as opaque strings.
//!
//! [`KnownArch`] enumerates the 18 architectures officially supported by Gentoo,
//! providing zero-cost representation and additional metadata like bitness.
//!
//! # Release Media Variants
//!
//! [`Variant`] represents the `{arch}-{tag}` format used for Gentoo release
//! media (stage3 tarballs, ISO images). The tag typically encodes the init
//! system and profile (e.g., `"amd64-openrc"`, `"arm64-systemd"`).
//!
//! # Interning
//!
//! Both `Arch` and `Variant` use string interning to reduce memory usage when
//! processing many instances (e.g., parsing an entire ebuild repository).
//! With the default `interner` feature, identical strings share a single
//! allocation via a process-global interners.
