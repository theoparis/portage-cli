//! Pre-flight build-dependency check (docs/build-roadmap.md, M2).
//!
//! Before the (potentially hours-long) build loop, verify that every plan
//! entry's build-time dependencies are present in the set that will be visible
//! when it builds:
//!
//! - a **Target**-routed entry's `DEPEND` is resolved against
//!   `roots.satisfaction_root(DepClass::Depend)` (BROOT for a native/
//!   same-arch build — there's no separate build sysroot when
//!   `CBUILD==CHOST` — or the target sysroot for a genuine cross build),
//!   plus the target's own VDB whenever it differs from that satisfaction
//!   root (`Avail::initial_depend`, so a package already built into a
//!   partially populated `--root`/`--prefix` from an earlier run still
//!   counts, even though the host lacks it);
//! - a **Host**-routed entry's `DEPEND` — it's built *at* `BROOT`, so its
//!   own build-time deps live there too — and every entry's `BDEPEND` are
//!   both resolved against the build host's own `BROOT` (`roots.satisfaction_root(DepClass::BDepend)`),
//!   *not* unconditionally bare `/` (a `--root`/`--prefix`/`--local`
//!   invocation's Host merges land at that BROOT, so that's what must be
//!   checked — see `todo/stage-build-shakeout.md` #28/#30/#31).
//!
//! Both sets grow with each earlier plan entry: a package merged earlier in the
//! run is visible to everything after it (root-model.md "within-run
//! visibility"). The solver already produces a complete dependency closure, so
//! this is a guard rail — it turns a would-be mid-build "command not found" /
//! missing-library failure into a clear, early error that names the dep.
