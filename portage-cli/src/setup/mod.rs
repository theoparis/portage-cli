//! `em setup`: bootstrap an unprivileged prefix layout so a subsequent build
//! (or the next `em --local` / `em --prefix DIR` / `em --root DIR` run) has the

//! it needs.
//!
//! Three modes (docs/design/root-topology.md § "Lifecycle"):
//! - `--local` (standalone prefix): EPREFIX set, base == target. Full closure
//!   into `~/.gentoo`; builds its own python via `toolchain --setup`, so no
//!   host-python symlinks. The `BASHRC_LOCAL` recipe (EPREFIX-based) covers the
//!   in-place search-path needs.
//! - `--prefix DIR` (overlay): EPREFIX set, base == host. Symlinks host
//!   python/base tools into `${EPREFIX}/usr/bin` for relocatable shebangs,
//!   then oneshot-merges `sys-apps/baselayout` (USE=build) so layout matches
//!   the profile — same as `em -1 baselayout`, not a hand-rolled mkdir tree.
//!   The `BASHRC_PREFIX` recipe covers overlay search-path needs.
//! - `--root DIR` (self-contained offset): no EPREFIX. Own everything; no
//!   CPPFLAGS injection (it actively breaks self-contained roots).
//!
//! Idempotent: directories are created if missing; files are written only when
//! absent, so re-running never clobbers a user's edits.
