//! Merge-behavior flags: everything `emerge_atoms`/`emerge_atoms_inner`/
//! `run_merge_plan` read to decide *how* to resolve and build a set of atoms,
//! as opposed to root-model flags (`--root`, `--local`, `--privilege`, …,
//! already `global = true` on [`super::Cli`] since they're meaningful to
//! every applet) or depgraph-shape flags ([`super::DepgraphFlags`]: `--deep`/
//! `--newuse`).
//!
//! Flattened both into the top-level [`super::Cli`] (for the bare `em
//! <atoms>` path) and into [`super::ToolchainArgs`]/[`super::CrossdevArgs`]/
//! [`super::StagesArgs`] (whose staged driver, `crossdev::run_staged`, calls
//! the very same `emerge_atoms`/`emerge_atoms_inner` chain per step) —
//! mirroring exactly how [`super::DepgraphFlags`] is already flattened in
//! both places. This lets these flags be written either before or after the
//! subcommand name (`em -j 80 stages --stage1` or `em stages --stage1 -j
//! 80`), each populating its own instance; the driver merges the two with
//! the same precedence (subcommand value wins when set, falling back to the
//! global one — the same precedence
//! `merge_depgraph_flags` already uses).
//!
//! `--search`/`--searchdesc` are deliberately NOT here: they select an
//! entirely different mode in the bare path (`run_emerge` branches to
//! `search::run_emerge_style` before ever calling `emerge_atoms`), so they
//! have no meaning for a subcommand's staged build. `--nodeps` is also NOT
//! here: it is already threaded explicitly per call
//! ([`crate::EmergeOpts::nodeps`]) because each [`crate::crossdev::stages::StageStep`] needs
//! its own value (the two-stage cross bootstrap's `--nodeps` libc-headers
//! step), not a single global/per-invocation one — folding it into this
//! mixin would lose that per-step distinction.
//!
//! Found 2026-07-03 running `em stages --stage1 -j 80 --keep-going`: `-j`/
//! `--keep-going`/`--autosolve-use`/`--autounmask-write` all parsed only
//! when placed *before* the subcommand (clap rejects non-global args placed
//! after one), and `run_staged`'s driver read them straight off the
//! top-level `Cli` regardless of where `stages`/`crossdev`/`toolchain`'s own
//! flattened copy might set them — so a flag given *after* the subcommand
//! silently had no effect even where clap did accept it. See
//! `todo/stage-build-shakeout.md`.
