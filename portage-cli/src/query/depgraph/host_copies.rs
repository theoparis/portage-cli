//! Native-offset host build-copies (Tier 1 `--root` for a Gentoo host).
//!
//! When building into an offset ROOT with the host (`/`) as `BROOT`/`ESYSROOT`,
//! a target package's build-time edges (`DEPEND`, `BDEPEND`, `IDEPEND`) that
//! the host *lacks* must be built on the host first so the target can compile
//! and link against them. emerge lists these as a second merge `to /` alongside
//! the ROOT runtime copy. Example: `net-misc/curl`'s `DEPEND="${RDEPEND}"`
//! includes `net-libs/{nghttp2,nghttp3,ngtcp2}`; if the host lacks them, emerge
//! merges each twice — once `to /eroot/` (runtime) and once `to /` (build).
//!
//! This is computed as a **post-solve closure walk** over the finalized Target
//! plan, NOT inside the solver: the dual `(package, merge_root)` solver nodes
//! share `PackageData` via `host_aliases`, and introducing `pkg@Host` into a
//! single solve balloons the Target closure (the Tier 1 aliasing blocker, see
//! `todo/nonemptytree-bdeps-gap.md`). Keeping the Target solve single-rooted
//! preserves its parity (12 packages for curl); the host copies are derived
//! against the host VDB afterwards.
//!
//! `cross.active` (any offset/dual-root context — plain `--root`/`--prefix`
//! included, not just cross-arch) can, for some invocations (e.g. crossdev's
//! own host-arch tools), still have the solver emit its own `MergeRoot::Host`
//! nodes directly into `target_order` — the invariant above doesn't hold
//! universally. This walk must never re-derive or duplicate those: it seeds
//! its availability and seen-set from whatever `MergeRoot::Host` entries are
//! already present, and only fills genuine remaining gaps
//! (`todo/root-topology-refactor.md`, the `dev-perl/Digest-HMAC` duplicate
//! finding).
//!
//! Host copies reuse the Target solve's version for a CPN (same arch, same
//! repo), falling back to the newest *accepted* (keyword/mask/license) repo
//! version for build-only deps absent from the Target plan. The walk is
//! bounded by the host's own availability (VDB, weaving in the `--prefix`
//! VDB the same way `bdepend_avail::Avail::initial_bdepend` does), which
//! already provides the toolchain (gcc, python, …) — so only the genuinely
//! missing libraries are scheduled, and each is emitted only after its own
//! unmet build edges (deps-first, not BFS discovery order) — matching the
//! no-forward-reference invariant `preflight::check` validates for the rest
//! of the plan.
//!
//! [`compute`] returns the **whole** reordered plan, not just the new
//! copies: each copy is interleaved directly in front of the first Target
//! entry that (transitively) needs it, by walking `target_order` in its
//! existing order and appending each entry's not-yet-emitted dependencies
//! right before it. This was originally a separate step (`mod.rs` spliced a
//! copies-only list returned here at position 0 of the whole plan) — wrong
//! whenever a copy depended on a seeded `MergeRoot::Host` entry that wasn't
//! already at position 0 (a forward reference, the same bug class this walk
//! exists to prevent for copies among themselves; caught in review before
//! landing). Interleaving during the walk itself removes the need for any
//! separate position-tracking: a copy discovered while visiting entry `E`
//! is always pushed immediately before `E`, so it's automatically after
//! everything `E` doesn't depend on and before `E` itself, with no
//! possibility of landing after a later consumer either.
